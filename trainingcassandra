1 Part I. ETL Pipeline for Pre-Processing the Files
1.1 PLEASE RUN THE FOLLOWING CODE FOR PRE-PROCESSING THE FILES
Import Python packages
In [51]: # Import Python packages
import pandas as pd
import cassandra

import os
import glob
import numpy as np

import csv
import psycopg2

Creating list of filepaths to process original event csv data files
In [36]: # checking your current working directory
print(os.getcwd())
# Get your current folder and subfolder event data
filepath = os.getcwd() + '/event_data'
# Create a for loop to create a list of files and collect each filepath
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(filepath):
# join the file path and roots with the subdirectories using glob
file_path_list = glob.glob(os.path.join(root,'*'))
#print(file_path_list)

Processing the files to create the data file csv that will be used for Apache Casssandra tables
In [37]: # initiating an empty list of rows that will be generated from each file
full_data_rows_list = []
# for every filepath in the file path list
for f in file_path_list:
# reading csv file
with open(f, 'r', encoding = 'utf8', newline='') as csvfile:
# creating a csv reader object
csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile)
next(csvreader)
# extracting each data row one by one and append it
for line in csvreader:
#print(line)
full_data_rows_list.append(line)
# uncomment the code below if you would like to get total number of rows
#print(len(full_data_rows_list))
# uncomment the code below if you would like to check to see what the list of event data #print(full_data_rows_list)
# creating a smaller event data csv file called event_datafile_full csv that will be used # Apache Cassandra tables
csv.register_dialect('myDialect', quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL, skipinitialspace=True)
with open('event_datafile_new.csv', 'w', encoding = 'utf8', newline='') as f:
writer = csv.writer(f, dialect='myDialect')

'level','location','sessionId','song','userId'])

2 Part II. Complete the Apache Cassandra coding portion of your
project.
2.1 Now you are ready to work with the CSV file titled event_datafile_new.csv, located
within the Workspace directory. The event_datafile_new.csv contains the
following columns:
• artist
• firstName of user
• gender of user
• item number in session
• last name of user
• length of the song
• level (paid or free song)
• location of the user
• sessionId
• song title
• userId
The image below is a screenshot of what the denormalized data should appear like in the
event_datafile_new.csv after the code above is run:
2.2 Begin writing your Apache Cassandra code in the cells below
Creating a Cluster
In [52]: # This should make a connection to a Cassandra instance your local machine
# (127.0.0.1)
from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
cluster = Cluster()
# To establish connection and begin executing queries, need a session
session = cluster.connect()
Create Keyspace
In [53]: try:
session.execute("""
CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS projectcassandra
WITH REPLICATION =
{ 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1 }"""
)
except Exception as e:
print(e)

Set Keyspace
In [54]: try:
session.set_keyspace('projectcassandra')
except Exception as e:
print(e)
2.2.1 Now we need to create tables to run the following queries. Remember, with Apache
Cassandra you model the database tables on the queries you want to run.
In [42]: try:
session.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS session_item")
except psycopg2.Error as e:
print("Error: Issue dropping table")
print (e)
try:
session.execute("""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS session_item (
sessionId int,
itemInSession int,
artist text,
song text,
length float,
PRIMARY KEY(sessionId, itemInSession) )
""")
except Exception as e:
print(e)
In [43]: file = 'event_datafile_new.csv'
with open(file, encoding = 'utf8') as f:
csvreader = csv.reader(f)
next(csvreader) # skip header
for line in csvreader:
firstquery = "INSERT INTO session_item (sessionId, itemInSession, artist, song, firstquery = firstquery + "VALUES(%s,%s,%s,%s,%s)"

2.3 Create queries to ask the following three questions of the data
2.3.1 1. Give me the artist, song title and song’s length in the music app history that was heard
during sessionId = 338, and itemInSession = 4
2.3.2 2. Give me only the following: name of artist, song (sorted by itemInSession) and user
(first and last name) for userid = 10, sessionid = 182
2.3.3 3. Give me every user name (first and last) in my music app history who listened to the
song ’All Hands Against His Own’
In [44]: ## TO-DO: Query 1: Give me the artist, song title and song's length in the music app history ## sessionId = 338, and itemInSession = 4
In [45]: # We have provided part of the code to set up the CSV file. Please complete the Apache file = 'event_datafile_new.csv'
with open(file, encoding = 'utf8') as f:
csvreader = csv.reader(f)
next(csvreader) # skip header
for line in csvreader:
## TO-DO: Assign the INSERT statements into the `query` variable
query = "<ENTER INSERT STATEMENT HERE>"
query = query + "<ASSIGN VALUES HERE>"

2.3.4 COPY AND REPEAT THE ABOVE THREE CELLS FOR EACH OF THE THREE QUESTIONS
In [55]: ## TO-DO: Query 2: Give me only the following: name of artist, song (sorted by itemInSession) ## for userid = 10, sessionid = 182
